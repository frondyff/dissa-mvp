# DISSA – Digital Inclusion System of Services Available (MVP)

This is a Streamlit-based MVP to support front desk staff at the Native Friendship Centre of Montreal (NFCM).

It:
- Lets staff select basic visitor context (age, language, needs)
- Retrieves relevant services from a small INDex-like dataset
- Uses an LLM to generate a clear, low-literacy handout
- Logs only anonymous interaction summaries for future analysis
